# SilentCall2
A dungeon crawler released to the XBox Live Indie Game service in 2011  
GameFAQs.com entry is [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/xbox360/653176-silent-call-2)

## Building
This code is not intended to be built. [Microsoft XNA Game Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=23714) would be required.  
The game was only ever built and tested on XBox 360. At least some of the code is 360 specific and will not build/run for desktop or phone.    
If you _do_ get it running; it will crash due to required assets not being present in the `SilentCall2\Content` directory. I'm unable to upload all the assets for the game as I don't have permission to redistribute the licensed music.
